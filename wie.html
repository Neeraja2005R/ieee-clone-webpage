    <i><p class="odd">IEEE WIE stands for IEEE Women in Engineering. It is a global network of IEEE members and volunteers dedicated to promoting women engineers and scientists and inspiring girls around the world to follow their academic interests in a career in engineering and science. The mission of IEEE WIE is to facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally.<br>
        IEEE WIE offers various programs, events, and activities aimed at providing networking opportunities, professional development, mentorship, and support to women in engineering and technology fields. These initiatives help address the underrepresentation of women in engineering and related fields and promote diversity and inclusion within the IEEE community and the broader engineering profession.
